Welcome to colorspacious's documentation!
=========================================

:mod:`Colorspacious` is a powerful, accurate, and easy-to-use Python
library for performing colorspace conversions.

In addition to the most common standard colorspaces (sRGB, XYZ, xyY,
CIELab, CIELCh), we also include: color vision deficiency ("color
blindness") simulations using the approach of Machado et al (2009); a
complete implementation of `CIECAM02
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02>`_; and the perceptually
uniform CAM02-UCS / CAM02-LCD / CAM02-SCD spaces proposed by Luo et al
(2006).
